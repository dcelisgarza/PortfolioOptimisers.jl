# Project documentation writing guidelines

## General Guidelines

  - Look at how other docstrings are implemented and try to follow similar patterns.
  - Write clear and concise documentation.
  - Use consistent terminology and style.
  - Include code examples where applicable.

## Grammar

  - Use present tense verbs (is, open) instead of past tense (was, opened).
  - Write factual statements and direct commands. Avoid hypotheticals like "could" or "would".
  - Use active voice where the subject performs the action.
  - Write in third person (one, the user) to keep statements consistent.

## Markdown Guidelines

  - Use headings to organize content.
  - Use bullet points for lists.
  - Include links to related resources.
  - Use code blocks for code snippets.
